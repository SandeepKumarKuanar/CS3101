/*Consider an integer array named marks containing the marks (out of 100) of five students. 
 Define a function grace_marks(), which takes an array of integers, along with the number of elements in the array, as arguments, and adds grace marks of 5 to those students who obtained less than 40. 
 Print the values of the array marks before and after passing the array to grace_marks().
